Data upload
===========

Several types of use cases evolves when working with different kind of measurement
instruments. So the raw input data of each measuring device can change in e.g. structure
and/or value units. In some cases the upload happes complete automatic. In the other cases
the data upload is done by humans, who firstly fetch the data files from our measurment devices and
secondly transfer them via our web interface into the database. When uploading data into the database,
we distinguish three types of upload mechanisms.

*(Insert picture of pseuso classes)*

Upload type 1: Normal data
**************************

This is the most common way to upload. All other upload mechanism derives from this kind of upload protocol.



Upload Type 2: Manual measured data
***********************************



Upload type 3: Log data
***********************

This is the most special way of uploading data. There are no real time series of data, rather
there are much more single data rows that are identified either with tuple of `dataset.valuetype`,
`dataset.site` and so on (Further informations :ref:`see dataset <schema-dataset>`), or with
an explicit `dataset.id`, to determine one matching dataset where the data row is appended to.
