# Usage

## Server operation

### Folders

The purpose of directories are explained.

#### `datafiles` folder
All files that are uploaded via the `download` view are placed in this folder.

#### `media` folder
CSS styles, images that are part of the software and JavaScript files that are included in the templates.

#### `preferences` folder


## Views

See [views chapter](views.html) for all views, that are displayed on the left side navigation bar of the user interface.

## Customization
### Logo and image

The user can customize the logo (1) and the background image (2).

<!--<img src="../../images/landing-page.png" alt="landing page" width="550"/>-->

![landing page](../../images/installation/landing-page.png "Landing page")


Therefore to change (1) the path `webpage/media/schwingbach-logo.png` and for (2) the path at
`webpage/media/navigation-background.jpg` has to be altered.


## Import data

The data import is one of the core features of the platform.
The import saves the measured data into a structured database schema.

The data import process consists of several steps, (1) upload files into the file system of the server and
(2) create import [configuration file (see)](usage.html#configuration-files) and (3) import via configuration into
database.
Already imported data can be further altered (split) and reused (transformations).

### Upload datafiles

Data files are uploaded via the `datafiles` tab. Measurement data can only imported by file. Therefore measurement files are uploaded onto the servers file system. Any file can be uploaded onto the servers file system.

### Import

It's only possible to import files with `xls`,`xlsx`,`csv` as file extension.
A data file has a maximum file size that it cannot exceed, otherwise the import algorithm will time out.

### Manipulate datasets

**Split datasets:**

### Configuration files

The import saves the measured data into a structured database schema. Unfortunately all measurement output of
instruments in the field have different structures. Therefore a solution is that the user has to provide a configuration
file, for each instrument-specific structure. A configuration file specify a key-value pairs-like mapping of
instruments data schema that's about to be written into the database schema.
The pair of keywords and their values (full list see below) have to be consistent, so the server can import the measured data.

The configuration file is a definition of the import process of all files in a directory.
The concept of a configuration file assumes, that in general each data files import information can be covered by a
description and multiple column descriptions.
A `import description` contains information that depict the import on file level and the `column descriptions` on column level.
All descriptions of the configuration, are made by the user once, contain all information to automatically import the data of multiple files.
So the user is able to omit most of the configuration of future imports for data files in this folder.

<!-- TODO all keywords -->

#### Import description keywords

  * **skiplines**: The amount of lines, which the import algorithm will skip, before reading data rows.
  * **delimiter**: Symbol used to separate the columns.
  * **decimalpoint**: Symbol used to separate decimal place
  * **datecolumns**: Number of column(s), which contains the date in **dateformat**.
  * **sitecolumn**: Number of column, which contains the site as character sequence.

#### Column description keywords
* **name**: name of the type of data, as defined for the [value type number](wiki.html#valuetypes)
* **column**:
* **valuetype**:
* **factor**:
* **minvalue**:
* **maxvalue**:
* **dataset**:


If no `{*}.conf` file is present in a folder, the parent directory is searched for a configuration file.

There should be only one configuration file per folder.

<!-- TODO: standard configuration (?) -->

<div class="note admonition">
  <p class="first admonition-title">File encoding</p>
  <p class="last">
  Configuration files are processed with the `configparser` module. This module requires that a file is encoded in `utf-8` or a subset.
  If a config file is not encoded in `utf-8` or a subset, when the file import is initiated in the config files directory
  a error message is displayed to the user.</p>

Configuration file example:

```pacmanconf
TBD.
; description part
[IC (Name of the config file)]
; TBD
instrument = 30
skiplines = 1
dateformat = %d_%m_%Y
datecolumns = 2
sitecolumn = 3
sample_mapping = {'A1W': '112',
 'A2W': '113',
 'A3W': '114',
 'B1': '85',
 'B2': '86',
 'B3': '87',
 'E1': '88',
 'E2': '89',
 'E3': '90',

 'F2': '80',
 'F3': '81',
 'FF1': '91',
 'FF2': '92',
 'GL1': '109',
 'GL2': '110',
 'GL3': '111',
 'K1': '82',
 'K2': '83',
 'K3': '84'}

; column part
[N-Nitrat (descriptor of the column)]
column = 5
name = N-Nitrat
valuetype = 16
factor = 1
minvalue = 0
maxvalue = 100
```
