## CUAHSI Systems

Two official tools are provided, to request data from a HydroServer. So these tools can also be used to debug the server behaviour.

1. HydroDesktop ([Windows application](https://github.com/CUAHSI/HydroDesktop))

2. data.cuahsi.org ([web userinterface](https://data.cuahsi.org))
    * Series ids in the workspace view don't display the series id in the local development database. Instead they are
    generated by the harvesting process, which collects the meta data from all HydroServer systems.
