ODMF Docs
=========

To provide information on the installation, the database schema and usage of the functionality of the spatial data
measurement observation software.

The documentation starts with a chapter about the platform, which covers the authors motivation and a brief overview
about the software components. After this a chapter with detailed instruction on how to install the software follows.
When having the platform installed and ready running, the chapter with information on how to use the individual tools
can be of great help.

If you want to contribute to the code base, you can get a grasp of the software coherences in studying the chapter on
development of the platform, where issues including the code base, the database model of ODMF and the migration to the
CUAHSI WaterOneFlow interface are described.
