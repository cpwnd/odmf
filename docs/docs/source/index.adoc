ODMF Docs
---------

To provide information on the installation, the database schema and
usage of the functionality of the spatial data measurement observation
software.

The documentation starts with a chapter about the platform, which covers
the authors motivation and a brief overview about the software
components. After this a chapter with detailed instruction on how to
install the software follows. When having the platform installed and
ready running, the chapter with information on how to use the individual
tools can be of great help.

If you want to contribute to the code base, you can get a grasp of the
software coherences in studying the chapter on development of the
platform, where issues including the code base, the database model of
ODMF and the migration to the CUAHSI WaterOneFlow interface are
described.
